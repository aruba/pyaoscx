# 2.0.0

## Notable Changes
**WARNING: V2 is NOT backwards compatible with v1 and earlier**
* Huge overhaul of the design - the libraries now use factories in order for the code to be more object oriented.
  Please read the [Design document](pyaoscx/DESIGN.md) file for more information.
* Removed previous workflow examples (defunct) and added /workflows/workflow.py as an example for using the new design
* Added directories for supporting files in /rest/v1 and /rest/v10_04
* Most of the previous libraries have been updated, but there are unsupported modules that are pending updates below:
   * ARP
   * Common_ops
   * EVPN
   * LLDP
   * Loop Protect
   * MAC
   * NAE
   * QoS
   * System
   * VXLAN
* Additionally, a few libraries have been migrated into other libraries:
   * bgp.py is now split between bgp_router.py and bgp_neighbor.py
   * config. py is now configuration.py
   * dhcp.py is now dhcp_relay.py
   * lag.py is now integrated into interface.py
   * ospf.py is now split between ospf_area.py, ospf_interface.py, and ospf_router.py
